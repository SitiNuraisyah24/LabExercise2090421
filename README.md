# MyJavaExercise

This is my coding based on given exercise by my CSC248 (Fundamentals of Data Structure) lecturer.

The exercise given was a simulation of a hospital management.

It calculates the extra pay based on oncall numbers and identify the houseman who is under the name Dr Daniel Iqram. Also it calculates the total salary that the hospital pays to the doctors.
